## Implementation
Both the quadratic equation solver and the cubic equation solver have been implemented by utilizing the programming language known as Golang, which was developed by Google. The quadratic equation solver utilizes the traditional quadratic formula, whereas the cubic equation solver utilizes a more complicated method to find all of the solutions (real and imaginary) to any cubic equation.

## Prerequisites
To be able to utilize these programs, it is necessary to install Golang or to use an online editor. Furthermore, these programs should be run in an environment that facilitates user input.

## Usage
In order to use these programs, it is first necessary to execute them by utilizing the "go run" command. It is also necessary to convert the equation that one wishes to solve into one of two forms: ax²+bx+c for quadratic equations and ax³+bx²+cx+d for cubic equations. It is then necessary to enter each of the coefficients into the command-line prompt, after which the answers will be printed on the next line.
